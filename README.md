# Game-of-Life
"Game of Life" is a console-based two-player board game developed in C++ with an emphasis on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. Players engage in strategic gameplay, utilizing their initial coin allocation to purchase hurdles, defenses, and navigate through a dynamically evolving game board.

**Features:**
* **Two-Player Board Game:** "Game of Life" is designed for two players to compete against each other, with each player initially receiving a fixed sum of coins.
* **Store and Purchases:** Players can spend their coins to buy hurdles to obstruct their opponent's progress or defenses to remove hurdles. Hurdles block movement for a specific number of turns, while defenses clear the path.
* **Progressive Levels:** The game consists of three rounds, each with an increasing board size. This adds complexity and strategy as the game progresses.
* **Coin Placement:** In the 2nd and 3rd levels, coins are randomly placed on the board, offering opportunities for players to collect additional coins as they advance.
* **Save/Load Game:** Players can save the current state of the game at any time and resume it later. This feature provides convenience and flexibility for users.
* **New Game Initialization:** Start a new game from scratch, allowing players to experience the excitement of the game's strategic challenges from the beginning.
